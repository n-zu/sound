# Sound in Js

## Sounds

`sound/sound.js` works as a wrapper for the basic Web Audio API features, providing a simpler interface.

It permits playing notes using common note names and octaves as-well as playing with other parameters such as wave type, and fade.

## Chords

`sound/chord.js` provides a simple interface for playing chords.

chords are defined as an array of notes, they can be built based on a root note and a chord type.

## Sandbox

The project includes a web sandbox to play with notes and chords in `/sandbox`.
